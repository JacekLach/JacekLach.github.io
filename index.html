<h1>Jacek Łach</h1>
<p class="small">Senior Backend / Distributed‑Systems Engineer • Remote (Poland, UTC+2) • <a href="mailto:jacekklach@gmail.com">jacekklach@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>12 years building back‑end platforms that "just work" and rooting out "impossible" bugs in large‑scale Java systems. Ex‑Palantir, now looking for a senior IC role in a 10‑100 engineer company where reliability and time-to-market matter.</p>

<h2>Core Strengths</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rapid root‑cause analysis of complex distributed failures</li>
<li>Attention to detail &amp; design allowing delivery of systems and features at all scales</li>
<li>Technical leadership without people‑management overhead; thrives in 4‑8 engineer pods</li>
<li>Hands‑on coding primarily in Java &amp; Python; picks up new languages and frameworks fast</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Selected Achievements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distributed index service:</strong> led 3‑engineer effort to build a pre‑computed index layer, shrinking typical query time on continuously updating 100TB+ datasets from effectively infinite (24h+ jobs that would often fail) → <strong>seconds</strong></li>
<li><strong>Zero‑maintenance miniservice:</strong> designed, implemented, and productionised a standalone Java service in 3 months; ran for 2 years with <strong>0 code changes</strong> beyond automated dependency bumps, eliminating maintenance and on-call load for a critical niche workflow.</li>
<li><strong>Mystery JVM lockups:</strong> resolved repeated full‑cluster freezes without access to heap dumps by crafting and analysing targeted runtime logging; resolving a ~monthly high‑severity user-facing incident.</li>
<li><strong>Mentorship:</strong> mentored junior engineers at Palantir; known for concise design reviews, catching subtle issues in advance, and clear explanations of technical tradeoffs.</li>
</ul>
